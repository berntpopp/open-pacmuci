# Repeat Nomenclature

open-pacmuci uses the **Vrbacka nomenclature** (extended from Kirby et al. 2013 and Wenzel et al. 2018) to classify each 60bp repeat unit in the MUC1 VNTR.

## Repeat Categories

### Pre-Repeats (N-terminal)

Pre-repeats occur at the beginning of the VNTR array, before the variable-length canonical region.

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `1` | Pre-repeat 1 (first unit of the VNTR) |
| `2` | Pre-repeat 2 |
| `3` | Pre-repeat 3 |
| `4` | Pre-repeat 4 |
| `4'` | Pre-repeat 4 variant (polymorphic) |
| `5` | Pre-repeat 5 |
| `5C` | Pre-repeat 5 variant |

### Canonical Repeats (Variable Region)

The core VNTR consists of canonical repeat types that differ by 1-3 nucleotide substitutions from the consensus **X** repeat.

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X` | Canonical repeat (most common; consensus sequence) |
| `A`-`Z` | Variant types differing by 1-3 substitutions from X |
| `aA`-`aZ` | Extended variant types (additional polymorphisms) |

!!! note "X is the canonical repeat"
    The **X repeat** is the most common type in the variable region. All other canonical repeat types (A, B, C, etc.) are defined by their specific nucleotide differences from X.

### After-Repeats (C-terminal)

After-repeats occur at the end of the VNTR array, following the variable-length canonical region.

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `6` | After-repeat 6 |
| `6'` | After-repeat 6 variant (polymorphic) |
| `7` | After-repeat 7 |
| `8` | After-repeat 8 |
| `9` | After-repeat 9 (final unit of the VNTR) |

## Mutation Naming Convention

Mutations are named using the format `RepeatType:MutationDescription`:

```
X:59dupC      -- dupC mutation in an X repeat
C:42_57dup... -- 16bp duplication in a C repeat
A:insC_pos23  -- C insertion at position 23 in an A repeat
```

**Components:**

- **Repeat type** -- which canonical type the mutated unit derives from (e.g., X, C, A)
- **Position** -- nucleotide position(s) within the 60bp repeat unit
- **Operation** -- `dup` (duplication), `ins` (insertion), `del` (deletion), `delins` (deletion + insertion)

## Example VNTR Structure

A complete allele structure reads left-to-right (N-terminal to C-terminal):

```
1 2 3 4 5 C F X X X X:dupC B A A B X X X V 6 7 8 9
|---------|   |---------------------------|   |-------|
Pre-repeats   Variable region (canonical)     After-repeats
              with one mutated repeat
```

**Reading this structure:**

- Starts with pre-repeats `1 2 3 4 5`
- Variable region contains canonical types (`C F X X X ... V`)
- One repeat is mutated: `X:dupC` (an X repeat carrying the 59dupC frameshift)
- Ends with after-repeats `6 7 8 9`

## Confidence Scores

Each classified repeat receives a confidence score:

| Score Range | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **1.0** | Exact match to known repeat type or mutation template |
| **0.9-0.99** | Very close match (1 substitution) |
| **0.8-0.89** | Close match (2-3 substitutions) |
| **< 0.8** | Low confidence -- possible sequencing error or novel variant |

!!! tip "Interpreting low confidence"
    Repeats with confidence < 0.8 may indicate sequencing errors, novel mutations not in the catalog, or alignment artifacts. Check the VCF for supporting variant calls.
