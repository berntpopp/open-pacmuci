## How Mutation Detection Works

### Step 1: Exact Match

Each 60bp unit from the consensus sequence is compared against all known repeat type sequences (~50 types). If an exact match is found, the repeat is classified without mutation.

### Step 2: Mutation Template Probing

If no exact match, the unit is compared against **pre-computed mutation templates** (~650 templates = 13 mutations x ~50 repeat types). Each template is the exact sequence a repeat type would have after a specific mutation is applied.

```
Example: X repeat (60bp) + dupC mutation = X:dupC template (61bp)
```

!!! note "O(1) lookup"
    For the 13 known mutations, detection is an O(1) hash lookup against the template dictionary. No edit distance computation is needed for common cases.

### Step 3: Edit Distance Fallback

If no template matches, the pipeline computes **Levenshtein edit distance** against all repeat types and reports the closest match as a potential novel mutation.

Novel mutations are still detected but with **lower confidence scores** since they do not match any known template.

## Clinical Significance

All 13 cataloged mutations cause **frameshift** in the MUC1 coding sequence, leading to production of the toxic MUC1fs protein. The most common mutation is **59dupC** (also known as dupC), found in the majority of ADTKD-MUC1 families worldwide.

!!! warning "Diagnostic use"
    open-pacmuci is a research tool. Clinical diagnostic use requires validation against established reference standards and is subject to local regulatory requirements.

## Adding New Mutations

The mutation catalog is defined in `data/repeats/repeats.json`. To add a new mutation:

1. Define the mutation operation (insert, delete, or substitution)
2. Specify which repeat types it can affect (`allowed_repeats`)
3. The pipeline will automatically pre-compute templates for all affected repeat types
