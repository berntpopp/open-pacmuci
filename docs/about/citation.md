## MucOneUp Citation

If you use MucOneUp for benchmarking or test data generation:

```bibtex
@software{muconeup2025,
  author = {Popp, Bernt},
  title = {MucOneUp: MUC1 VNTR Simulation and Analysis Toolkit},
  year = {2025},
  publisher = {GitHub},

  note = {Software version available at https://github.com/berntpopp/MucOneUp/releases}
}
```

## Methods Section Template

Use this template when describing open-pacmuci in your methods:

> MUC1 VNTR analysis was performed using open-pacmuci v[VERSION] (Popp, 2026; https://github.com/berntpopp/open-pacmuci), an open-source reconstruction of the PacMUCI pipeline (Vrbacka et al., 2025). PacBio HiFi CCS reads were mapped to a synthetic reference ladder (150 contigs, 1-150 repeat units) using minimap2. Allele lengths were determined using gap-based clustering with indel-valley splitting. Variants were called per allele using Clair3 with the PacBio HiFi model. Consensus sequences were classified into repeat units using the Vrbacka nomenclature with pre-computed mutation template matching.
