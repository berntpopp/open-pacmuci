# Deviations from PacMUCI

open-pacmuci follows the architecture described in Vrbacka et al. 2025 (Figure 1) but makes several deliberate changes to improve accuracy, reproducibility, and usability.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | PacMUCI (Vrbacka et al.) | open-pacmuci | Rationale |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Read mapper** | bwa-mem 0.7.16a | minimap2 2.28+ | minimap2 is the standard for long-read alignment; faster and more accurate for HiFi data |
| **Reference ladder** | 120 contigs (1-120 X repeats) | 150 contigs (1-150 X repeats) | Covers the full observed VNTR length range (Vrbacka reports alleles up to 125 repeats) |
| **Variant caller** | Clair 2.0.7 + Clair3 1.0.10 | Clair3 only (latest HiFi model) | Clair is deprecated; Clair3 subsumes its functionality with better accuracy |
| **Read filtering** | Manual IGV inspection for chimeric/incomplete reads; MAPQ > 4 filter | Automated read extraction per cluster + remapping to peak contig | Reproducible; no manual step required |
| **Allele detection** | `peaks.py` (idxstats peaks, details unpublished) | Gap-based clustering + indel-valley splitting | The indel-valley algorithm resolves close allele pairs (3-9 repeats apart) that simple peak-finding merges into one |
| **Mutation detection** | Custom Python scripts (unpublished) | Pre-computed mutation template catalog (13 known mutations) with exact-match-first probing | O(1) lookup for known mutations; no edit distance needed for common cases |
| **Flanking trim** | Fixed-position trim (assumes flanking is invariant) | Anchor-based trim using flanking/pre-repeat boundary sequences | Resilient to indels in flanking region caused by Clair3 false positive calls |
| **Same-length alleles** | Treated as homozygous (Clair3 skipped) | Disambiguated using Clair3 het genotype detection | Detects compound heterozygotes where both alleles have the same repeat count |
| **Confidence scoring** | Not reported | Per-repeat and per-allele confidence with VCF cross-validation | Enables automated QC; flags low-confidence calls |
| **Source code** | Proprietary (unpublished) | MIT license, fully open source | Reproducibility and community contribution |

## Detailed Explanations

### Read Mapper: bwa-mem to minimap2

The original PacMUCI used **bwa-mem 0.7.16a**, which was designed for short reads. While bwa-mem can align long reads, **minimap2** is the community standard for PacBio HiFi data. It is faster, produces more accurate alignments for reads >1kb, and handles the high GC content of the MUC1 VNTR more reliably.

### Reference Ladder: 120 to 150 Contigs

Vrbacka et al. report alleles with up to 125 repeat units. The original ladder (1-120) would miss these extreme alleles. Extending to 150 contigs provides headroom for rare long alleles without significant computational cost (the ladder FASTA is ~1.5MB).

### Variant Caller: Clair + Clair3 to Clair3 Only

The original pipeline used both **Clair** (deprecated) and **Clair3**. Since Clair3 subsumes Clair's functionality with improved deep neural network models specifically trained for HiFi data, open-pacmuci uses Clair3 exclusively.

### Read Filtering: Manual to Automated

The original PacMUCI required **manual IGV inspection** to identify chimeric and incomplete reads. This is not reproducible and does not scale. open-pacmuci automates this by extracting reads per allele cluster and remapping them to the peak contig, eliminating the need for visual inspection.

### Allele Detection: peaks.py to Indel-Valley

The original `peaks.py` script (unpublished) detected allele lengths from the idxstats read count distribution. When alleles are far apart (>10 repeats), this works well. For close alleles, the read distributions overlap and simple peak-finding fails.

**Indel-valley splitting** is the key algorithmic innovation in open-pacmuci. It analyzes CIGAR indel lengths to identify two local minima in the indel series, resolving allele pairs as close as 3 repeats apart. See [Core Concepts](concepts.md#indel-valley-splitting) for details.

### Mutation Detection: Scripts to Template Catalog

The original mutation detection used unpublished Python scripts. open-pacmuci pre-computes the exact sequence of each known repeat type after each known mutation is applied. This enables **O(1) exact-match lookup** for the 13 most common mutations, with edit-distance fallback for novel mutations.

### Flanking Trim: Fixed to Anchor-Based

Fixed-position flanking trim assumes the flanking region is invariant. In practice, Clair3 sometimes calls false positive variants near the VNTR boundaries, causing indels in the consensus flanking region. **Anchor-based trim** searches for known boundary sequences (pre-repeat 1 start, after-repeat 9 end) and is resilient to these artifacts.

### Same-Length Alleles: Homozygous Assumption to Het Detection

When both alleles have the same repeat count, the original PacMUCI treated them as homozygous and skipped Clair3. open-pacmuci instead runs Clair3 and examines **heterozygous genotype calls** to detect compound heterozygotes where both alleles are the same length but carry different mutations.

### Confidence Scoring: None to Per-Repeat Scores

The original pipeline did not report confidence. open-pacmuci assigns a score (0.0-1.0) to each classified repeat unit based on match quality. VCF cross-validation adjusts scores when Clair3 variants confirm or contradict the classification. This enables automated QC filtering.
